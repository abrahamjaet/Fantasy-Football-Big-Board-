# Fantasy-Football-Big-Board-
Purpose: Make your own fantasy football rankings to help you on next years draft. 
Interface: The interface consists of the computer prompting the user to select between two players. Relevant statistics to compare will also be shown. The user will then select which one he prefers all else equal. The idea is by narrowing decisions, the user will be able to create a more unique and custome big board. 

Update: 
    1/10/23: Finally a very very rough draft of ranking QB's. No stats beside team is shown & does not save. 33 QBs. Using algorithm based on nCr and domination.
